# Action Plan for StrikeSim Implementation

# Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

## 1.1 Enhanced Agent Classes ✅
- ✅ Worker: Add state (striking/not striking/non-member), current_wage, savings, union_dues, participation_history
- ✅ Employer: Add revenue_markup, concession_threshold, daily_revenue, total_balance
- ✅ Union: Add strike_fund_balance, strike_pay_rate, dues_rate, network_policies

## 1.2 Network Generation System ✅
- ✅ Create network generation functions for both employer and union structures
- ✅ Implement hierarchical network generation (executive → department → team levels)
- ✅ Add network activation/deactivation based on policy changes (caucuses, picket lines)

## 1.3 Calendar and Time Management ✅
- ✅ Implement proper calendar system with working days/weekends
- ✅ Create monthly review cycles and daily interaction cycles
- ✅ Add date-based simulation tracking

# Phase 2: Core Economic Model

## 2.1 Financial Flows Implementation ✅
- ✅ Implement wage calculation with concessions
- ✅ Create strike pay distribution system
- ✅ Add union dues collection
- ✅ Implement employer revenue calculation based on working days
- ✅ Create balance tracking for all agents

## 2.2 Morale System ✅
- ✅ Implement the three morale specifications (sigmoid, linear, no-motivation)
- ✅ Create private morale calculation based on financial position
- ✅ Implement social interaction system for "vibes" calculation
- ✅ Add network-based morale propagation

# Phase 3: Decision and Interaction Systems

## 3.1 Participation Decision Model ✅
- ✅ Implement daily strike participation decisions based on morale threshold
- ✅ Create participation tracking and statistics
- ✅ Add strike success/failure detection

## 3.2 Policy Implementation ✅
- ✅ Implement union policy changes (strike pay adjustments, caucus formation)
- ✅ Add employer concession/retaliation policies
- ✅ Create monthly strategy review system

# Phase 4: Data Management and Analysis

## 4.1 Data Storage ✅
- ✅ Implement HDF5 storage for full time series data
- ✅ Create CSV export for summary statistics
- ✅ Add Monte Carlo simulation support

## 4.2 Visualization and Analysis ✅
- ✅ Create network visualization tools
- ✅ Implement time series plotting for key metrics
- ✅ Add statistical analysis functions

# Phase 5: Settings and Configuration

## 5.1 Enhanced Settings System ✅
- ✅ Expand settings.py to include all model parameters
- ✅ Add network structure parameters
- ✅ Include policy configuration options
- ✅ Add calibration parameters

# Phase 6: Interactive Dashboard ✅

## 6.1 Streamlit Dashboard ✅
- ✅ Create interactive parameter controls
- ✅ Implement real-time simulation execution
- ✅ Add live visualization of results
- ✅ Include download functionality for results

# Phase 7: Output Management ✅

## 7.1 Timestamped Output System ✅
- ✅ Implement time/date-stamped output folders
- ✅ Organize all simulation outputs (HDF5, CSV, PNG)
- ✅ Separate outputs for different simulation runs

# Recommended Implementation Order ✅
- ✅ Start with Phase 1.1 - Expand agent classes with all required attributes
- ✅ Phase 1.3 - Implement calendar system for proper time management
- ✅ Phase 2.1 - Build financial flows (this is the core economic engine)
- ✅ Phase 2.2 - Implement morale system (this drives participation)
- ✅ Phase 3.1 - Add participation decisions
- ✅ Phase 1.2 - Implement network generation
- ✅ Phase 3.2 - Add policy systems
- ✅ Phase 4 - Data management and visualization
- ✅ Phase 5 - Complete settings system
- ✅ Phase 6 - Interactive dashboard
- ✅ Phase 7 - Output management

# Key Technical Considerations ✅
- ✅ Configuration: Make all parameters easily adjustable through settings.py
- ✅ Validation: Build in checks for model consistency and edge cases
